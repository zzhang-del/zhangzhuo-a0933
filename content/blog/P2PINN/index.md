This poster introduces **P2PINN: A Pseudo-Time Stepping and Parameterized Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework for Navier-Stokes Equations**. Our work addresses two major limitations of traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): unstable training and the necessity for retraining when PDE parameters change.

P2PINN tackles these issues by:
* Integrating a **pseudo-time stepping method** to significantly stabilize training, even for complex problems like the Navier-Stokes equations.
* Employing a dedicated **encoder network** that extracts hidden representations of PDE parameters. This enables the network to learn a generalized solution across a wide parameter range by training on just **two** PDE parameters.

The key benefits of P2PINN are enhanced training stability and remarkable computational efficiency. Our framework achieves a **2â€“4 orders of magnitude speedup** compared to standard PINNs, all while maintaining high accuracy. This allows for rapid interpolation and extrapolation to unseen parameter sets.

This research is a collaborative effort with **Dr. Xiong Xiong from Northwestern Polytechnical University**. We wish him the very best for a successful and early graduation!
