## Summary & Overview


This paper presents the culmination of my master's research: a significant study on improving the preoperative grading of meningioma, a common brain tumor. This work, recently accepted by the prestigious **Physics in Medicine & Biology (PMB)** journal, introduces a novel approach that combines **radiomics** (extracting features from medical images) with **deep learning** techniques.

We developed a unique **Transformer-CNN hybrid model (MFEM)** that effectively integrates both local and global image information. A key innovation of our study is the exploration and demonstrated value of **peritumoral edema (PTE)** regions‚Äîthe swelling around the tumor‚Äîin enhancing grading.

This project is a collaborative effort with my good friend, **Dr. Ying Miao from Peking University**. I wish her all the best for a smooth and successful graduation!
