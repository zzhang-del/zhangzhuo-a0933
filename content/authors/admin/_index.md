Hi! I'm Zhuo Zhang, currently a visiting scholar at Seoul National University in South Korea. My research is supervised by Prof. Canqun Yang (Deputy Chief Designer of the Tianhe-2 project). I earned my M.S. degree in Information and Communication Engineering from Tiangong University in December 2023, where I was supervised by Prof. Yong Yang (recognized as a Top 2% Scientist Worldwide) and Prof. Hua Bai.

My research interests include AI4S and medical image processing. If you're interested in AI4S or medical image processing, feel free to reach out!
